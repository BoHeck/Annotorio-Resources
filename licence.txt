My source code is licensed under the main licence.

But since this mod contains the works of many different artists, it is not possible to release under a unified licence.
So in every relevant folder there is a licence document compiling licence-information. The listed licence is allways the original licence.
If i made changes to a file of another creator, then the new artwork is allways released under the same original licence.

All licences do not include the right to use the name "Annotorio" in any derivative work except when giving attribution.

Special thanks to the developers of "Unkown Horizons" http://unknown-horizons.org/ . If possible give this game a shot , it is open source and free!
